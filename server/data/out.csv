Only a one good waitress try to help us out after she saw that our actually waitress was just ignoring us the entire time. We end up leaving because we had already waited for more than an hour for our food and the stupid manager blamed on the kitchen. But it was the waitress cause I saw my food being there ready for more than 15 minutes sucks for them cause I normally tip at least 8 dollars cause I have a kid of 2 years and I know they not easy but for ones my daughter behave and the place was in his worse.

1.0,Franco Marraf,"Bought vouchers on Groupon for $30 'value of $60'. So the Rip Off starts here.  You order off a separate menu for a 3 course meal which you would normally pay $30 for - but apparently its value is $60.....?   So you get over the blatant rip-off so hopefully the food/service/ambiance makes up right....  Not so.  The food is below average at best - service a little stoned and the ambiance was loud dark and confused.  This restaurant has so many issues, obviously suffering (hence the vouchers) they then serve crap over valued food to potential new customers?  I don't get it - nor will you, but in 2 years I bet they will be closed or re-imaged.

It was ITS OWNER who earned it only 1 star: met him by chance while taking a friend to the restaurant; we started some small talk, and then he completely, absolutely, ignored me, concentrating on my friend (heck, he even gave his personal business card ONLY to my friend).

4.0,Chris Springer,"Parking is awful. There are not enough spots for the normal occupancy. There's the option to valet for $3, or get your car washed for $12 which is very convenient.   There green sauce is only good before Wednesday after that it tastes rather bland, I'm not sure if they make the salsa at the beginning of the week or what but that's something I've noticed. The steak fajitas are excellent. I believe they use a higher grade cut of steak, which is probably why the fajitas are a little pricey (there's also the option to upgrade to tenderloin). The re-fried black beans are great along with their green rice.  The food here is great and outside of Pappasitos, it's the one of the top 3 Tex-Mex joints in town.","['Tex-Mex Restaurant', 'Latin American Restaurant', 'Mexican Restaurant']",107390227071306429060,1346255440,"Aug 29, 2012",100067551847332999384

3.0,Kimberly Guel,"Me and two girlfriends ate here yesterday evening by accident. We planned to go to Raku, but I guess it's closed...? Oops. But anyways, It was around 6:00 pm so there wasn't a crowd. The atmosphere is inviting and the decor is modern and vibrant. The server was friendly and fairly knowledgeable. We had the Firenze Pizza (mushroom and sausage), the Brooklyn Pizza (chicken, broccoli, Gorgonzola) and the Carpaccio. The pizza wasn't the best I've had but I guess it wasn't the worst. I couldn't really taste the Gorgonzola and that's a pungent cheese. It tasted a little overdone on the bottom although it was flimsy. We each ordered the mango Bellini-those were yummy! In conclusion, I probably wouldn't get pizza again because I don't think it's worth the $14. Maybe I'll come back for a drink and happy hour one day though.","['European Restaurant', 'Italian Restaurant', 'Pizza Restaurant']",100060334350346730154,1370017901,"May 31, 2013",100077206753915182395

5.0,Rebekah C,"Graze is one of the main reasons I travelled back to the Mount Pleasant area!  I became nervous before I arrived for the second time, wondering if I had made it better in my mind as time had passed.  When the first appetizer arrived (Pulled Pork and Collard Green Mac n' Cheese) I knew I had not just imagined how good the food is at Graze.  Luckily I dined with a table full of sharers, and was able to experience multiple appetizers, salads, and entrees.  Each of them was delicious.  Even when I thought I couldn't eat another bite I HAD to make more room for the Wild Mushroom Papperdelle.  In addition to the food, the atmosphere and our fantastic server made us feel like we were VIP.  Before we left we tried to convince them to open a location in our home town.

1.0,Blake Butler,"Unfortunately, over the past few months the prices have increased, service is slower, and quality has decreased. The prices have gone from affordable to very high in my opinion. All meats are now $14.95 per pound. I have never worked in the food service industry, but I dont understand how beef brisket, spare ribs, baby back ribs, pulled pork, turkey, and sausage all cost the same. I went there today and ordered a half pound of baby backs and a quarter pound of brisket. The cashier entered my ticket incorrectly for a 1/2 lb babys & 1/4 lb babys. I noticed this when I checked my togo container and asked about the brisket. Honest mistake, and I asked her to double check to make sure I receieved 3/4 lb of ribs. (Cost was $12 and there were only three ribs plus the heel.) My request wasnot received well and the tall cook with glasses in the kitchen was very upset. They asked me to step up to the counter to look in the kitchen at the scale to confirm, implying I had accused them or wrongdiong. I really couldn't tell anyways because he weighed it in the container with sauce, onions, pickles, and jalpenos. He was bobbing his head and staring me down like he wanted to fight. This seemed like a lot of drama over asking someone to double check my order. I did not request to look at the scale and, if they brought it back without anymore ribs I would have trusted them. Babys are inconsistent with the amount of meat on them, so I just wanted to make sure the kitchen did not make a mistake like the cashier. When I got back to work i was disappointed with the babys. The meat did not fall off the bone like it used to, and there was a lot more fat on them. All of the things that kept drawing me back have vanished and I will not be returning ever again. It seems they are unable to keep up the same quality with volume increase from their popularity. It is a sad drop off from the first time i went to this place and I expect to see more posts like mine in the future. I am not a BBQ fanatic and for the same price, I will be spending my money at Luling on Richmond instead.","['Barbecue Restaurant', 'Caterer', 'American Restaurant']",110106737007796553010,1336154678,"May 4, 2012",100087869357383711639

All dishes are made fresh upon ordering except the dessert bar which has a fair selection of creative sweets. While most of the dishes were not traditional Indian recipes, all of them had Indian-inspired flavors and were very tasty in their own right. The wait-staff was very attentive and had perfect timing on brining out the next round of dishes.

4.0,Colin Sullender,"I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner. There was a small group of people waiting and we were told 15 minutes. Walking to the bathroom, I noticed that only half the tables were in use. There were more tables available than twice the number of parties waiting. We ended up waiting nearly 40 minutes before being given a table. The same table that we had been standing next to the entire time.   Everything proceeds smoothly from here until the delivery of food where my order was lost/forgotten. Once the waiter realizes that we're trying to get his attention and that my food is missing, he runs off to find it. After another 5-10 minutes, I finally get my Stuffed Poblano Chicken.   I usually don't complain about food unless it warrants it. This chile relleno was one of the blandest things I have ever eaten. The chicken was tasteless and dry. The ""jack cheese"" was just a white mass that competed with the chicken for blandness. The only way to save this travesty was gratuitous application of the house salsa (actually good).   And now for the kicker: One of my fellow diners went to the women's bathroom and returned with a horrifying tale. There was standing water covering the bathroom floor that appeared to be coming from one of the toilets. Upon mentioning it to an employee, she was told that it was ""just a leak and that they cannot get it fixed during the weekend."" What? That's stupid. There are 24/7 plumbers for EXACTLY THIS SCENARIO. You are running a food establishment. You shouldn't have any water, more or less toilet water, covering the floor of the bathroom. And you absolutely shouldn't tell your guests that it's not a priority to fix it. Disgusting.","['Tex-Mex Restaurant', 'Latin American Restaurant', 'Mexican Restaurant']",107697434372719181440,1369191911,"May 21, 2013",100284885731728066560

He told me oh well maybe they should put pictures on the menu.  I then told him no they don't need to put pictures but for these exuberant prices they need to portion the food accordingly . i have eaten this same combo at many of the finer establishment and the portions were double and often times less expensive .   i will never go to this establishment again and will never recommend this place.

4.0,Jimmy Ho,"Some of you may know I did not eat barbecue till I started college. I grew up in the Houston area, but I had no sense of the barbecue scene there. The only BBQ joint I have eaten in H-Town was at Goode Company Barbeque. An ex-girlfriend introduced me to it, and I liked the food so much, I wanted to eat there every time I go home. It had all changed the last time I ate there though. I had just finished my first marathon, and my wife and I went there to ""celebrate."" The brisket was dry and not good. They also did not have any moist but only lean? Weird. Everything I ate was forgettable and borderline bad. We were going to Houston this time for the Justin Timberlake concert. I know. You can blame the wife on this one. This at least gave me an opportunity to try some new places. I consulted the Texas Monthly Top 50 list for some help and ended up choosing Gatlin's BBQ because it was not out of our way to the hotel.  Trying to park around Gatlin's was a pain. It was in an industrial part of town, and they were busy as well. A good sign, right? The eating space inside was a little bit cramp. They did have outside seating, but we were not tempted to do so on this cold day. Did you know that the pitmaster/owner Greg Gatlin used to be a defensive back at Rice? [insert Miley Cyrus voice] ""That's pretty cool."" Today I ordered the usual- brisket, ribs, and sausage. Surprise, surprise. The brisket was solid. It had a good crust with a nice smoke ring. It was a tad dry and could have used a little bit more salt, but I still liked it. The ribs were the winner here. They were tender and juicy and had an excellent rub/glaze. The smoke was also on point as well. I could probably have eaten a rack of them. The homemade spicy sausage definitely had a kick. I like the grit and casing, and it had an ideal flavor. I also got some potato salad and coleslaw on the side. The potato salad, although mustard based, was really good. It was eggy and sweet. The coleslaw was not bad either. I should have tried the dirty rice. I heard it was delicious and awesome. Maybe next time?  Gatlin's BBQ is a definitely a great choice for barbecue in the Houston area. I enjoyed everything I ate, but I wanted something more. For once, the hype got to me but do not get me wrong. It is worth the visit no matter where you live in Houston or beyond. I also met Greg's mom, Mary. She has to be the nicest person in the barbecue business. Next time I go to Houston, Gatlin's will be definitely on my radar again.","['Barbecue Restaurant', 'Caterer', 'American Restaurant']",110106737007796553010,1389667073,"Jan 13, 2014",100396798302758010113

2.0,Tiffany Morgan,This location is always soo busy but they never have enough employees. There isn't enough tables without the bar stools in the main part of restaurant.  The playground is bigger than most so that's a plus. But the lack of employees allows the kids to get away with climbing over the mesh barriers & jumping on top of the tubes. I have a 3yr old and he was too scared to come down the slide for he was afraid the slide would fall on him. Several times an employee came into the playground area and none of them said anything to those kids. I find that completely irresponsible on that child's parents and McDonald's. I would hate to be there when a child falls or worse.   I am more likely to go through the drive-thru then go inside. Which is sad cuz my kid loves McDonald's.,"['Restaurant', 'Fast Food Restaurant', 'Hamburger Restaurant']",110526219169991433828,1365368058,"Apr 7, 2013",100486184561052197561

Bread is the number one ingredient in the Sub, the most important component.   Their bread was not bad nor great. It was fresh, but being fresh doesn't mean being good. It tasted like it was from HEB. This place could be one of the best sub joints in Houston, it has potential if only they had better sub bread.  The good, is that the rest of ingredients were fresh and tasted very good, the place was clean and the price for a 6"" sub is $3.99, pretty cheap.  I would eat there again and again, but if they really want to make great subs they need to find another bakery or make their own bread.","['Pizza Delivery', 'Takeout Restaurant']",116519006932560933578,1383855419,"Nov 7, 2013",100521268270727703956

You get to see the kitchen working their magic. I am a huge foodie and have brought a diverse group of people here again and again. The service is WONDERFUL! Very attentive, clean and knowledgeable.There is nothing worse than a waiter that can't explain the menu thoroughly. This place trains their waiters very well. Granted, treat them well and you will receive great service. The dishes are creative twists to classics. The portions are moderate. The prices are on the higher range of dinning. You must take into account the location, which is prime real estate in Houston, the quality of food and service. Overall, a really great go to spot. Wonderful Friday and Saturday dinner or drink spot. At the end of dinner, each time I've gone, we received an extra to-go treat. Each time has been different as well. We've had a cinnamon-nutty muffin and a macadamian nut cookie bar. This contributes to the 4.5 stars. Going home with treats is a super plus!! Please continue to do so. It really sets you apart from other restaurants. The money is in the details!! The only thing stopping them from getting 5 stars is elevating the food a tad bit more. Consistency is key is this type of industry so I hope they read their reviews and keep up the good work.   As for those that said it was too loud or too expensive. Sorry you feel that way, have dinner at a  coffee shop and research the location and menu before you decide to dine.

This hole-in-the-wall establishment has been around for quite sometime now I assume. The small dining area is adjoining a smaller grocery section. Their most popular items include fish curry (ilish/hilsha) and handmade sweets. We went during lunch time, the owner (or seemed like the owner) was taking orders and cashing that day so once it was our turn, he took our order but didn't seem to want to explain anything to us, he seemed rushed and grumpy. Funny thing is most of the restaurant was empty. While the food is great and tastes authentically Bangladeshi, the portions are meager, as they give you a lootttt of sauce with few pieces of chicken or fish in it. We also took a box of rasmalai on our way out only to find out that it was spoiled. So much for the hype! I think their food is good but if you know how to make bangladeshi food, you can whip up stuff like this at home. My main gripe is about their customer service, the owner (and his relatives) seem to know nothing about customer service.",['Indian Restaurant'],117076505016707933435,1378342769,"Sep 4, 2013",100635138311836767242

3.0,Emily King,"We were hungry at 3 a.m. while visiting some friends in the neighborhood, so we came here for a bite. As one of our friends said, ""It's what you would expect for Mexican food at 3 a.m.""  I would have certainly been very disappointed had I read some of the rave reviews on here before going, but, again, it was perfectly fine for 3 a.m.  We got the steak fajita enchiladas and chile relleno.  The texture of the chile relleno was a little off.  The fajita meat was a little dry. The salsa verde just tasted like blended jalepenos -- it was spicy but somewhat flavorless.  The salsa roja was fine.  The tortillas, which were dried out and crunchy in places, were by far the worst part of the meal.  The service was very quick and the prices reasonable.    Would I go there again if I were hungry in this neighborhood late at night?  Yes.  Would I go there at any other time of day?  No.  Would I come in from a different neighborhood to eat here? No.","['Mexican Restaurant', 'Latin American Restaurant', 'American Restaurant']",109686825474320666208,1374332052,"Jul 20, 2013",100647123067526011947
3.0,Emily King,"I have not yet eaten food here, but it looked quite good.  Also, the coffee drinks and cocktails looked quite interesting, but I only wanted beer.  I may return and re-review this place afterwards.  I came here to meet up with some friends for a nightcap.  With one exception, the tap list consisted of Texas craft brews.  The one exception was Petrus Aged Pale from Brouwerij Bavik, which was quite a surprise to have on tap.  While waiting for friends to arrive, I started to look up the reviews of the beers on their tap list on Rate Beer and was shocked by how poorly most of them were reviewed.  We all ended up ordering the only IPA on the list, which happened to be the only well-reviewed beer (except for the Petrus), but they were out of that one. They had another IPA which was not as good.  Although the host seemed a bit confused and mumbled a lot, the server was very friendly and outgoing.  The couches and comfy booths gave the place a very relaxed atmosphere.  I'm definitely willing to give this place another chance.","['American Restaurant', 'Coffee Shop', 'Brunch Restaurant']",112027576770826653150,1375895135,"Aug 7, 2013",100647123067526011947

I wanted chicken, baby back ribs, and brisket.  As a lifelong barbecue cook and expert who has competed in thousands of competitions and fed tens of thousands of people I know cook times on barbecue.  The chicken should have been done first.  At any rate I settled for baby back pork ribs, and sliced beef brisket.  Then they told me to come by at 12:30 to pick up my order!  Folks that is 50 minutes to prepare a pound of ribs and a pound of sliced beef brisket--I can do that work in less than 1 minute with one hand tied.  So I show up at 12:30 and WAIT another 30 minutes for these slow moving folks to prepare my food.  No sense of urgency.  When I get back to my office with brisket that was obviously not freshly cooked, it is crusty and dry and just barely warm, the ribs are better but over cooked and exposed to too much smoke--likely pecan wood. The Dirty Rice is good, the green beans are canned but passable because they are properly seasoned and bacon is present.  The whole meal was $46.87--for bad barbecue!--Ouch!

4.0,Seher Dholakia,"Whenever I'm in Houston, people always suggest going to yuppie brunch spots like Benjy's or Baby Barnaby's, when all I really want are Buffalo Grille's buttery pancakes, cheesy stuffed baked potatoes, and delicious french toast. Don't get me wrong, those places are pretty good, but sometimes all you really want is a brunch that's not going to break the bank and a waiter/waitress who is not going to bother you every five minutes and coax you into leaving. Thank goodness for Buffalo Grille where a good meal usually costs me $8 or less and you can stay there hours on end without being bothered.   I first discovered Buffalo Grille on New Year's Day and it was the best hangover cure ever. DON'T JUDGE ME, I know this is a family friendly place, but sometimes you need some good breakfast food to cure a bad hangover. Our group got tons to order, but among my favorites were the hash browns (so golden and crispy!), strawberry french toast, omelette, and my absolute favorite was the stuffed baked potato (#4) that has cheese, avocado, salsa, and so much goodness in it. Seriously, I still crave it. I've been back a couple of times and once a friend got their cream cheese and chive eggs which were also delicious.  The place is not a fancy restaurant by any means, but it definitely is cute and cozy. It's great for big groups and their menu selection is huge, so it will definitely satisfy any taste.

5.0,Kiril Kundurazieff,"Hello, Houston! I relocated here, from SoCal, in Sept 2012.  A friend recommended this place, last week and I have been twice, eating the same meal each time.  Bosnia, being part of the former Yugoslavia, just as the homeland of my father, Macedonia, had been, how could I resist? And the place is within walking distance of where I live!   It specializes in Bosnian cuisine, tasty dishes that would be familiar to anyone with roots in the Balkans.  8 appetizers, all under $8, 7 soups and salads, all under $7.  7 entrees, all under $12, 6 sandwiches, all under $8.  4 house specials, all under $20, 5 pizzas, all under $10.  4 desserts, all under $4, and a variety of fountain drinks, bottled sodas, and drinks, and coffees, all $3 or less.  The place is located across the street from the Target and Randall's, in a small, unassuming, little shopping center. I was welcomed at the door and chose a table in a back corner, next to some framed photos of the ""old country"", and a handful of old Yugoslavian bills and coins..  My order?  Bosnian Grah, Potato Burek (Pita), Stuffed Peppers, Bosnian Goulash, all washed down with several glasses of Dr. Pepper (thank God for free refills!).  Total cost: $24.25 + $3.75 gratuity = $28.  Yes, I ate all of it, except for a portion of the Burek, which I took home to finish later.   To say that everything was absolutely delicious barely does it all justice.  The restaurant has plenty of seating, and the atmosphere is enhanced by the Bosnian music playing in the background, as you eat.","['Eastern European Restaurant', 'European Restaurant']",109828550915123270689,1363659376,"Mar 18, 2013",100961543962198879533

4.0,Jonathan Nassar,"March 2014 If you're in downtown and are craving Vietnamese food, this place should be on your shortlist even though you might want to drive here.  And, on that though, the two biggest downsides to the place is the atrocious parking and that it's oddly dark, especially toward the back. They have some lamps back there, but clearly not enough.  Once you actually get parked and walk in (and have your eyes adjust), you take a seat and someone takes your order. When you're done, walk up to the register to pay.  The food, is great. The banh mi comes on a french bread that has a great balance of crispy and soft - too many places use bread that's either all soft (french bread should not be soft) or is rock hard (eating french bread should not cause pain). The pho broth is wonderfully dark and beefy. This place seems to really love their Vietnamese soups.  They also have Vietnamese coffee varieties that you can't find everywhere - with or without condensed milk, served hot or cold. Similar options of tea might be nice. Or maybe if they partnered with a bakery to serve more baked goods.

We started with Les Noix de Saint-Jacques, which is a seared scallop dish. The scallops were prepared perfectly and came with an amazing lobster sauce, which we later sopped up with our bread.  My wife got the new york strip, which was also just right. It came with a side of potatoes au gratin served in a cute tiny le creuset pot and the ragout was more a sauce made with diced tomatoes rather than pureed and were excellent. It was better than the bearnaise sauce, which I think she would have preferred on the side.  I got the crispy rosemary pork belly, which stunned me with deliciousness at every bite. The side of creamy polenta was expertly prepared, and I also got root vegetables (beets, which were good though I'm not a beet fan) and excellent brussel sprouts. There were also drops of a super thick balsamic reduction, which added a nice counterpoint to the rest of the flavors. I would have liked a bowl of that.  We ended off with their decadent chocolate rum cake, which came with not enough ice cream for the cake, but it was also very good. Not the best dessert options in town (but remember the company I'm comparing this place to), but some very creative options.  It's also worth mentionig that our by-the-glass wine options (a Cote du Rhone with our meals and a Marquis de la Tour with our dessert) were excellent, though we didn't get help in choosing them (we didn't ask for recommendations) and many places nowadays have respectable selections.",['French Restaurant'],109152901334936672701,1351261719,"Oct 26, 2012",100997035942150556481

1.0,Janie K.,"ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF, OWNER IS TERRIBLE, CHEATED GROUP INTO $410 BILL, AND ONLY GAVE US HALF OF OUR FOOD!!!!!  First, we're all Indian and KNOW the value of our food, what our food was worth for 12 people was altogether no more than $150 TOTAL (INCLUDING TIP).  The owner tried to up-sell us on EVERYTHING, was extremely pushy and we ended up ordering for the entire table 2 of the ""BOMBAY FEASTS""  and 2 of the ""TANDOORI FEASTS"" that were each $49, yes, that's right $49.  So for $200, you expect it to feed 12 people right? WRONG! THIS GUY IS A CON ARTIST!!!!!  THE OWNER TRIED TO COMBINE PLATES TO GIVE US LESS FOOD, WE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED 4 DISHES OF EACH, INSTEAD WE RECEIVED ONE OR TWO PLATES EACH AND WERE TOLD HE ""COMBINED THEM INTO ONE PLATE""   WE RECEIVED OUR TWO ORDERS OF THE ""TANDOORI FEAST"" (REMEMBER THIS COST $49 EACH, SO IT'S A $100).   WHAT DO WE GET? ONE PLATE, YES, ONE PLATE OF TANDOORI CHICKEN WITH ABOUT 8 PIECES OF MEAT ON IT. THAT'S A $100 PLATE OF TANDOORI CHICKEN THAT ANYWHERE ELSE WOULD HAVE COST $15 AT THE MOST!!!!!!!  WE PAID $100 FOR A PLATE OF TERRIBLE TANDOORI CHICKEN!   (THAT IS TWO TANDOORI FEASTS FOR $49 COMBINED AND PUT ON ONE PLATE, INSULTING TO SAY THE LEAST)  WE ALSO DID NOT RECEIVE TWO ORDERS OF PRAWN CURRY, TWO ORDERS OF SAAG, OR THE TWO EXTRA ORDERS OF CHICKEN TIKKA. INSTEAD HE POINTED TO A SINGLE PORTION OF CURRY AND SAID.... ""I COMBINED THE TWO ORDERS INTO ONE."" OUTRAGEOUS. WHEN WE ASKED A WAITER, HE SAID ""NO, THAT IS ONLY ONE ORDER."" WE CONFRONTED THE OWNER AND HE JUST LIED.  EVERYONE AT THE TABLE WAS OUTRAGED AND BECAUSE OF THE OWNER'S DISHONEST AND TASTELESS MOVE OF ""COMBINING"" OF DISHES AND GIVING US HALF IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE US ORDER MORE FOOD. FRUSTRATED, AFTER HE REFUSED TO BRING US WHAT WE ORDERED, WE HAD TO ORDER MORE DISHES TO GO AROUND.  IT WAS ANGERING TO SAY THE LEAST AND WE ALL CONSIDERED WALKING OUT.  IN THE END, THE BILL ENDED UP BEING NOT $200, BUT $400 AND THE OWNER DID NOT APOLOGIZE ONCE FOR CHARGING US AND COMBINING PLATES AND BRINGING US HALF THE FOOD. HE'S AN ABSOLUTE JERK.  HE ALSO WENT AHEAD AND ADDED A $50 FLAT TIP TO THE BILL FOR HIMSELF, ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF. THIS GUY SHOULD FRY IN HELL.  DO NOT GO  HERE EVER.  SERIOUSLY.  BY THE WAY, THE FOOD ALSO SUCKED.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere for the family or a date, but it isn't too serious as to go with friends and enjoy a lively meal.  The staff is great. The hostess was welcoming and efficient in getting us in and seated (on a busy night.) Waiters/waitresses are all polite and helpful. Good with the specials and the wines. Crowded every time I've been but you're not packed in or lacking in privacy at your table. Manager came by during the meal to make sure everything was up to expectation.  But man.... the food. Oysters are the best I've had in Houston on the half shell. The crab bisque I had was amazing. Last time I was there, I had one of the specials which was a lightly crusted rainbow trout with cream sauce, risotto and spinach - I was telling friends about this meal afterwards. Outstanding. Everything I've seen come out of the kitchen looks and smells unbelievable.  Also, save room for dessert - the bread pudding is the best I've had, on an impressive dessert menu.","['Seafood Restaurant', 'Steak House']",100590801304910381561,1359927222,"Feb 3, 2013",101283959465347663079

2.0,Bang Bui,"Some of the food like the pad thai tasted like it was reheated, like the oils were starting to separate from the noodles. I tasted the fried rice and found it to be very oily and not well cooked. The curries I tried out were very watery, not as creamy. The third one I tried with the tofu, the one that was darker than redder than the rest, tasted very foul. I came home feeling bloated and not very good. As of this writing at night, I still feel this way. Oh yeah, they hardly ever refilled my water, and every time they passed me by, they didn't bother to ask. They did once, but I was already leaving.

4.0,Bang Bui,"I've tasted quite a few Indian restaurants in this area, but Tandoori Garden's selection and dishes were like the 3-star rating describes: A-OK. For a $9.99 buffet, I do admit that is quite a pretty cheap deal for Indian food. But there's a reason why it's priced at $9.99. Even before I tasted the dishes, even before I took a look at the food, I could tell by walking inside what the quality was going to be like. When I approached the food at the counter, the chicken tikka masala had a chunky consistency, instead of the creamy texture I would see at other Indian buffets. The saag paneer had more of a runny appearance than it did of thickness. The tandoori chicken was just chopped into pieces rather than left whole as a leg.  Overall, I found the waiters to be very friendly. The restaurant is too far from my house to come back and experience again, but that didn't affect my rating, though.  You can go to a really nice-looking restaurant and get terrible food and service. You can go to a hole-in-the-wall restaurant and receive a wonderful dining experience. It just really depends on the effort made by the proprietor.","['Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'South Asian Restaurant']",107865344984470745240,1361216677,"Feb 18, 2013",101486490108402566778

4.0,Bang Bui,"I'm impressed with the quality Bombay Pizza Co. had offered my co-workers and me when we arrived at our company meetup in August 2012. I love eating Indian food, so when I discovered that a pizza restaurant's topping specialties are particularly just that, I knew this place would be a great spot for us to enjoy.  I ordered the Saag Paneer pizza, while my co-workers had gotten the Berry Bombay and the Bombay Ranch. All the specialties were delicious. Interesting crunchy thin crust, rich cheese taste, fresh-tasting ingredients, I really want to eat again and again had it not been so expensive. For my co-worker with the Bombay Ranch, she specifically asked for the cilantro to be removed, so they had to re-do the pizza and remove the cilantro and she had to wait longer, although it wasn't a big deal since we shared pizzas with each other.  I had a great time with my co-workers there and spent 3 hours talking about work and whatnot, and we just enjoyed the atmosphere all the while. I do not live in the Downtown area, nor do I commute/drive to work there, but I will visit the Sugar Land location more often since it is closer.

2.0,Mayme G,"It's really a 1.5.  Do not go here unless you like poor service and mediocre food at high prices.  It was a horrible experience.  My husband and I ventured inside the loop for the first time since we moved back to Houston a few months ago to go to a movie that was playing next door.  We should have stayed in the suburbs.  We wanted Mediterranean food and figured we had plenty of time to eat and get to the movie with time to spare as we had nearly an hour and a half.  We were almost late.  We both order the gyros.  The service was slow and inattentive.  I decided that I would like to have a domestic beer as it was happy hour all Sunday.  The waiter brought me a beverage menu and I saw that Shiner Bock was listed with the other domestic beers for $3.25 and the imports were priced at $4.50.  The happy hour price was $2.00 for domestics and $3.00 for imports.  I thought a $2.00 Shiner would be nice with my gyro.  I wish this was all about the price of the beer but my satisfaction level was already at zero rapidly moving into the negative range before the bill came.  Did I mentioned the service was slow and inattentive?  My water glass was empty for most of the meal and only refilled as we were waiting for the check and then by the hostess.  I had to ask the waiter more than once for additional sauce, unfortunately a quart of tzatziki sauce wouldn't have improved the gyro meat which was as dry and overcooked as cardboard with almost as much flavor.  The salad and fries were okay but no better than what I could purchase with bagged salad and bottled dressing.  By the time the bill arrived we were running late and the waiter informed us that Shiner is considered an ""import"" with the happy hour price being $3.00...an entire 25 cent discount off the regular price.  At this point I told him fine after he insisted that it was final from the mgmt. but there would be bad internet reviews.  He took it back to get it corrected only to wait and finally told him we had to leave now.  We paid the $3.00 price, as we were leaving the manager came out too late.  There's got to be a place in the NW burbs where I can find a decent gyro that doesn't cost me $10 for bad food.","['Mediterranean Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'Middle Eastern Restaurant']",113229077765358908772,1378075102,"Sep 1, 2013",101508431784897122812

It was better, but geez it was so salty I had a problem washing it down without a drink. My waitress.. I dont remember her name but she was so rude to me.

Some people have commented on the cost, and I guess compared to other restaurants near you would think that, but you get what you pay for and its nowhere near the cost of going somewhere else near by for the same quality.

The vegetables were a little spicy with curry for my tastes but that is because I don't like spicy. The naan was the best I've ever had hands down. They make it themselves fresh everyday!!! The second time I went I got the tandoori chicken with rice and chic peas. Again the veggie was a little too spicy for me. The tandoori chicken wasn't what I expected since it wasn't served with yogurt sauce on it. And be warned!!! The green sauce they do serve it with is extra hot. I got garlic naan that time and it came out fresh out of the clay pot. Soooo good!!!  The owners have had this place since october '12 and they are always very friendly and attentive to us. Only negative I may have is that the lunch buffet does only have three types of meat everyday. But you can order from the menu if you want variety. I would and do highly recommend.,['Indian Restaurant'],112826750712645814093,1361734775,"Feb 24, 2013",101820377343254881246

We ordered good when the group was under 6. Our food was brought out but held as we were moved to a table to accommodate more guests by one of the floor managers. Once the head manager was aware, he cancelled the order of those who previously ordered and whose meals were ready and told us we had to order from the $35 menu. This after ordering and waiting for our initial order for more than an hour an a half. The entire party decided to leave. The head manager, Josh Jennings was extremely rude an non accommodating. I reported this to their corporate office but received no reply. If this is how they are allowed to treat their guest, I will never return or refer others. I added a picture of the manager.

I came home from work expecting my pizza to be delivered any time. at 6:25 i decided to call and check on my order. i was told that it was on the way. at 6:45....... still no pizza. i called the store and spoke to the ""manager"", Gloria, (very unprofessional). She lied to my face again and told me that my pizza was out for delivery. i almost canceled my order but at this point i was willing to see how lat they could actually be. i received my food at about 7:20. i asked the delivery guy when he left the store and he told me that he had left the store five minutes before he arrived at my house. i actually gave him a pretty good tip for being honest. he gave me a free pepsi.

We were regulars for take out but things have definitely changed.  The food quality and customer service is bad!! We called in a pick up order -  1.They didn't have half the items on the menu on a friday night at 6:20pm 2.We called in the order but 20 mins into the wait time, they called and said they didn't have the ribeye we ordered we had to order something else but my husband was already on the way to pick it up.   3.The order was still wrong and we were charged for items we did not order 4.The calimari appetizer was burnt and cooked with rancid oil 5.The spinach dip appetizer was not mixed and contained large clumps of cream cheese 6.Pecan Crusted Trout was overcooked and literally tasted like cardboard When we called to talk to them about how horrible the food was, they said that we could come back and they would take the items off the ticket - Really!!  Another trip to Sassafras so they can give money back on those items, well that isn't what they did.  They gave us some of the money and a $20 certificate?  We aren't going back so the $20 certificate is worthless.  When I called the owner - Diego he said that I had to bring the other food back to get the rest of the money so another trip and when I said that this would be a forth trip to them in one night his comment was ""that is not my problem"".  So 4th trip but Diego called the police when I came in with the food.  He and the cashier told us that they were giving us the money back and went in the back acting like they were processing the credit but they were waiting until the police arrived.  So the police arrived and they had to give the $20 in cash instead of certificate.  Amazing that these guys called the cops on their own customer then the resolution with the cops was that they had to pay for the food they told us to return.

My kids loved it, and they have a revolving sushi bar that is on a conveyor belt that goes by the tables.  Had hot sake and it was good, pleasant buzz to it. The eel was good, tuna good, roe fresh, calamari was excellent, the nori, cucumber, rice, avocado, ginger, all great.  Sauces tasted fresh,  Overall if I had any complaint it would be that the waitress was almost too happy! and that's not a complaint. I went in on a Saturday afternoon before 5pm. $100 bill, $25 tip. 5 stars from me.  and for the other guy who blamed this place for his girl getting sick, it takes at least 24 hours for a food born illness/virus to start affecting your body unless it was an allergic reaction, so sorry, maybe she just ate something that didn't agree with her, I mean no offense.","['Sushi Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'Seafood Restaurant']",111781297165831261155,1378085403,"Sep 1, 2013",102026591734521825759

3.0,eric trejo,"I'd give this a 3.5 cus it's better than okay for the concept, offerings and taste.  To me this is Good Quick & or late night Food! The there's good flavor and the right size portions depending on how hungry you are.  Bao's: The buns are thick and soft, but dont seem that way when you eat them. They have an interesting texture and are slightly chewy in a good way. I really Loved the Bao's for use as a holder for the food!  Food: Crab Daddy is really tasty but the only thing i did't like is the non meat part like the stuff that's grainy and green (but again that's a whole crab). it throws off the flavor but gives it a lil salty sea taste to it if you like that. But since its fried I'd eat this 1st as it won't be as good if it sits since you get a lil oily aftertaste  Memphis BBQ was really good.The flavors of the Asian slaw, beef and the glaze on it all parried nicely for the final flavor. I couldn't get enough of the slaw juice as it really tasted good on this! The texture of this one was great as the meat a lil tender but firm, to the soft and chewy bao with the slaw as medium between each giving it more filling than just the meat and bao.  Onion Rings were really good, there not the best I've had as they're a lil thin but the batter is light and crunchy and has more volume than the others I've had. So that made it up for me with the Kimchi-mayo! They have a light flavor despite the seasonings which didn't really seem to add much too it as it wast salty or hot. And the Kimchee-mayo is more mayo from what i tasted than kimchi, even if the cabbage is blended into it... my guess is so that everyone will like it  Inside: The inside is small but not too small, they do have a few small tables in the front but the rest are those high rectangular tables that kinda seem to throw it off a lil for me as not going well with the theme. as my 1st impression was a chill and laid back spot from the front and then when you look to the side it reminds you of hooters. so there's not much privacy there if you bring someone... other than that they have a few small screens and the place is kinda relaxing  Final thoughts: I do wish they had maybe some dipping sauces or juice sauces (Asian slaw) on the side, it seems like they have a good start and have a few more things to add to the menu or offer. I was surprised at the beers they offered and they even have free cumber water lol. There wasn't much spice as i had thought but the flavors are there, like i said i guess its to attract a wide rang of people just trying to venture out and not be scared away. Another good thing would be to offer a spicy version along with the regular one!  Upon eating my food i got to talking to sun and he was a informative and helpful about the menu and food. I was really interested in alot of what they offered and were about. And come to find out that kimchee-mayo has actual cabbage in it, so +1 for getting your veggies in! Lol and they make alot of there sauces and even ramen  too! They apparently just started up 11 months ago so I'm glad i ain't missed this spot like soo many others   My only thought to keep this food up to par would be to keep the oil fresh! As it does detract from the food if its not and will make it taste just like greasy fast food that wouldn't be that good. I loved the taste and will definitely keep coming back if everything is the way i remembered it as far as the flavors and taste, since its really close by.",['Restaurant'],105975813964843685196,1380572946,"Sep 30, 2013",102169869959618294100

The menu was simple and you had to know what you were getting otherwise you dont know whats in it, not even a take out menu to see either. The menu board is plain cut for the foods offered and they have a special of the day written on the center of it. It smelled clean and was slightly dark but after seeing some people get there food and smelling it, it took me back to what i knew the food was suppose to smell like if i had tasted it! The lady taking my order even spoke spanish too so huge plus if you speak any spanish.  I ended up getting a few things to try out and see if the place was any good...  Beef Seekh kebab – Is Very Deliciously Fragrant with a lil bit of heat for flavor. The meat seemed to be mixed with a kind of sausage for flavor. There’s 2 per order (1.5 dia x 8” lng) and worth the price, this goes great with the green sauce  Samosa aloo - is ok because of one of the spices didn’t make it taste right to me; I’m think it was a pepper as it wasn’t hot but kinda threw off the taste for me. The crust was crunchy and potatoes were firm and soft, moderately spice and fragrant. It was hot and hadn't sat out like other places. If they have a sweet tamarind sauce it’d be better or you could take the sweet tamarind sauce from kobab korner and make it taste better  Green sauce - is creamy, has cilantro in the taste with the heat of peppers in the front that’s really good! The consistency is a lil thicker than water and holds more spices than some others. I like the flavor profile of the sauce a lot! Way better than kobab korner!",['Restaurants'],113076969571004526901,1383337526,"Nov 1, 2013",102169869959618294100
5.0,eric trejo,"Had the tiger roll, eel roll and 2 eel sushi with their strawberry desert.
 The sushi was good as well as the tiger, eel roll was ok. But all rated great with the ponzu sauce. The stand out thing for me was the desert. Very soft vanilla ice cream with  chrunchy sweet crunchies at the bottom. A side of strawberry sauce that had a hint of yogurt to it and gave it a nice tart/bitterness. The taste and textures of this dish Beat Everything else for me! I came for the Happy Hour so I'm sure it'd be way better for the other items","['Japanese Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'Sushi Restaurant']",114966743572702228256,1361986338,"Feb 27, 2013",102169869959618294100

5.0,Touleng Vang,"The brisket is as good as any other fine bbq joint.  The bbq sauce is a nice compliment to all the meats...it has a gravy consistency and the flavor isn't too over-powering.  The pork roast is very tender.  Skip the beef short ribs; they were disappointing...either over-cooked or yesterday's special (dry and hard).  The stuffed baked potato is a must-try and a meal in itself.  They offer two versions; traditional and bbq.  I ordered the traditional cause I already had a plate of bbq.  My only complaint is that I would've preferred the dish being tossed in the oven for a minute or so to melt the cheese and heat the bacon bits, as they were both served cold...the heat from the potato was only good enough to melt the chuncks of butter beneath the pile of toppings...but this is my own preference and many of you would care less.  The jambalaya was very good...no complaints of overseasoning here.  The fries were nice and crispy.  I'll have to make time on a weekend and try their ox-tail dish.  Overall, this is a great place for bbq and fried seafood.  The prices are very reasonable and you certainly get your money's worth.",['Barbecue Restaurant'],111679948434214638830,1328213872,"Feb 2, 2012",102187165175482609052
4.0,Touleng Vang,"Damn good tacos (and prices) for a mini chain restaurant!!! The bistec tacos have great flavor and a nice spicy kick to them. The charro style beans are excellent, with lots of Bacon flavor! Just when you think it couldn't get any better, the gringa steps it up a notch amazing flavor!!! It's like they brought the taco truck indoors...the food is simply amazing!!!","['Mexican Restaurant', 'Latin American Restaurant']",112742757842529493724,1350319460,"Oct 15, 2012",102187165175482609052
2.0,Matthew Conner,I ordered two pizza's for some of my friends. They were 45mins late delivering the pizza  to Calhoun Lofts (walking distance of Pizza Hut).  By the time the pizza guy understood how enter the building my friends had left and gone to eat somewhere else.  The drivers excuse was they had a big order before and forgot about my order even though it was ordered 2 hours prior.  I will be ordering from other pizza places from now on that have educated staff and drivers that know how to deliver on time.  Oh and the Pizza was cold and stale.,"['Pizza Restaurant', 'European Restaurant']",105534100441913459129,1352424053,"Nov 8, 2012",102189747484413355419

The atmosphere is nice and standard for CPK, service was dry and seemed as though they were just going through the motions and when I say they I mean the entire staff from the front door to the manager.

0,4.0,John Cleary,"I decided to try this place on Veteran's day. They offered free meals for all veterans, so I should not have been surprised by the long line. We actually showed up at about 7:45 pm. After seeing the line leading from the doorway to the end of the walkway, across the parking lot and back down the aisle to about even with the door, I decided to go elsewhere. Before I got back to the car though I changed my mind, so back we went to the end of the line. Only about 10 more people joined the line after that. It took us about 1 hour to get through the doors, then maybe 15 more minutes to be seated. During our wait we passed the time talking with another vet with whom we shared a table over dinner. Now you are probably expecting complaints about the wait, the poor selection of food at this late hour, the noisy atmosphere, etc. Well, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the full offerings of fresh entrees being served as soon as the serving dishes got low, and how delicious everything was. I would have expected the help to be extra tired and ready to be rid of the crowds by the time we were finishing up, but everyone that we had contact with was very helpful and genuinely friendly. I especially liked the barbequed pork ribs. The meat was falling off the bone tender and juicy. Same goes for the chicken. The yeast rolls were fresh and warm and the best tasting I've ever had. Great sliced to order ham at the carving station.Great soft serve ice cream cones, a chocolate fountain with goodies to dip, and pumpkin pie for deseert. And to top it off they make fresh cotton candy for anyone that wants it. Haven't seen that since the '60s.I say be a little adventurous, try it with an open mind, and you may very well like it.","['Restaurant', 'American Restaurant', 'Buffet Restaurant']",111748715694950717292,1353991715,"Nov 26, 2012",100107606861639428359

0,4.0,Lauren Rodino,"I went to the Tomato Bistro last night for the first time because I had heard that they were a vegan-friendly place and I was really excited that they offered vegan cheese on their pizza.  However, because no one else I was out with wanted a pizza with vegan cheese, I figured I'd get the quinoa salad and the portabella sliders instead. I told the server I was vegan so I'd be asking for a few modifications and it didn't seem to be a problem. I ordered the sliders with vegan cheese instead of the mozzarella and the quinoa salad without the feta cheese.  10-15 min later the server comes back to tell me that the sliders have heavy cream on them (which is not on the menu) so she will go back to the kitchen to give them a heads up not to make them for me. I order the regular frites and I tell them just to give me ketchup because I assume their sauces will NOT be vegan.   Everyone at my table gets their food and 10 minutes later I am presented with the portabella sliders, heavy cream and all. I send them back and wait another 15 minutes for my frites while my table is already on to their entrees. My frites come and not only do they have non-vegan sauces, but they are also topped with cheese. I'm getting really frustrated at this point but just eat the ones from the bottom--although it kindof defeats the purpose of being a vegan if I'm not even reducing my impact.  Finally my salad arrives and (as far as I can tell) it is vegan and it is very delicious. I'm glad that I have that to say about them at least.   All in all I'm really happy that they offer vegan cheese for their pizzas and it's a good step forward, but I'm disappointed to say I can't report having a good experience there.     TLDR: They advertise as vegan-friendly but the kitchen struggles to make this happen. If you want to go here and eat vegan, I seriously recommend going when they're not busy AND calling ahead.","['Italian Restaurant', 'European Restaurant', 'Bistro']",105467046411284484289,1372615977,"Jun 30, 2013",100258266989784791011

Granted it doesn't compare to the quality of the (still closed) Titaya's Thai Cuisine, but it's definitely not bad. I regularly get the Guay Tiew Tom Yum noodle soup or the Gang Garee curry, both of which are reliable and delicious dishes. I've gotten the Pad Thai dish once but it was nothing spectacular. They definitely skimped on the spicy level that I had requested (5 stars, always).   Ordering for takeout is always quick since this place never seems that busy inside.

They didn't cut the duck table side. We had appetizer size plates for the whole meal. When the entrees finally arrived all four were served at once and crowded the table badly.

The hostess/server seated us in front of the stadium sized television, as a kind of spectacle for the seven other patrons. We received grease stained paper menus, and had to ask for our own eating utensils. The Diet Pepsi we ordered was flat and syrup-y. After ordering and a thirty minute wait, our stone cold entrees made their way to our table. My stack of pancakes and fried egg came out frigid with a strange pre-packaged ""syrup""  when opened had a viscous, hot glue like consistency, I'm assuming it was long expired. My mother ordered their vanilla bean french toast, but received their ""banana foster"" version smothered in rum soaked rotten bananas. My sister ordered a basic ""BLT"" which was lacking the lemon garlic aioli, the menu described, instead it was dry toast, lettuce, burnt bacon, and tomato. And furthermore, since when did an ""assorted fruit cup"" consist of day-old grapes served in a filthy ramekin? All in all, every entree ordered was missing at least one thing, and plan on waiting for butter, toast, coffee to be brewed, and forget about receiving any type of re-fill on a beverage. My advice would be to bring a flask/water bottle to wash down the atrocious menu items. The last thing I would like to add, is an overall warning to future patrons. Forget making plans after eating at ""Plate"" because you surely will need to visit a restroom, twenty to twenty-five minutes later to have explosive diarrhea in six minute intervals. But if the food poisoning hits you faster than it did I, don't plan on using their restrooms, because they lack soap, paper towels, and toilet paper. So, good luck and I hope this helps.

When we received our order, she never brought the dressing I requested. It took about another ten minutes until she came back to the table for me to even ask for it. After our meal, she didn't ask if I wanted a box for my food because I had so much leftover. She almost took away my plate before we could even ask for a carry out box. After bringing back the box and the check, we waited for about half an hour until we finally just got up and took our check to a different waiter. She walked past our table about 6 or 7 times and didn't even look over. Needless to say, she didn't get a good tip at all. Since it's located right on the water, it had beautiful views.

The salads and fresh bread are amazing.  This is one of my favorite places for lunch.  It can be expensive but the portions are generous.  Ask for a lunch portion which is half a sandwich.  They bring fresh bread to the table and their is olive oil to dip it in.  The gelato is amazing my favorite flavor is nutella.  I don't like the salted carmel, all I tasted was salt.  I usually have the Vegetariano Panini.  There a woman I think is the owner who goes around and asks how you are doing.  All the staff is great.

The pasta had the consitancy of paste, the shrimp tasted just plain bad, the meat selections (turkey, ham, (supposed) prime rib, and one unidentifiable type) tasted awful and was bone dry, the other food was lukewarm at best and the steamed vegetables were almost soup-like in quality they had been  there so long. Crab was available, and if you could get a shell cracker it was okay, but there was no butter available and nothing for a hand wipe after except the rough polyester napkin the silverware was rolled in. Service was embarrassing. When the waitress finally arrived and tea was requested, she brought ONE...so I shared it with my wife. The final touch was the pie (no dessert bar at a $30 buffet that had no more than 10 items on the line) which was obviously frozen and tasted so bad that even though my wife and I shared  a single piece, we left 3/4th of it on the plate.  Bottom line: DO NOT EAT HERE. Hit someplace like Old Country Kitchen and you will actually get better food, more choices, and the same general atmosphere. YES, this place is THAT bad.","['Bar & Grill', 'Banquet Hall', 'American Restaurant']",106334168516188181254,1388016153,"Dec 25, 2013",100671399402441049970

0,2.0,Alex Gibson,"Went on a Saturday night and the place was pretty empty. Despite this, we still had to wait a few minutes before a waitress came to seat us. Afterwards, I had no problems with the waitress. Very attentive, and when asked for suggestions, she didn't immediately suggest the most expensive dish. Yes I do that on purpose as a test which she passed.   I like the look of the place. Maybe could do with darker walls, but I'm nit picking now. I could tell that the owner was aiming for a more modern look. Had no problems with that. Looking at the rolls they had confirmed this. I like how they tried to make the place innovative with VERY original concepts for the rolls. My problem was the execution.   First, was the miso soup. The soup was pretty sweet. Good miso soup needs to be balanced, both sweet and savory. The savory was too underplayed. Next came the eggrolls. The eggrolls themselves were acceptable. Nothing special but nothing to complain about. Tried the sweet and sour sauce. It looked like it was made in house so props to that, BUT, somehow, it tasted like ketchup. How do you do that?! Because the rolls were so unique, I ordered the champion roll combo with half rolls of Mile High, Shotgun, and Pebble Beach.   Mile High: There was an overpowering flavor of.... something, that I couldn't identify at first. I only knew that it just didn't taste right. After sampling different parts, I realized that it was the light brown sauce over powering the rest of the roll. The sauce should NEVER overpower ANY dish. A sauce is a compliment to the dish; not the dish itself. Think of the sauce being the picture frame that holds the painting (dish).   Shotgun: I couldn't not try this one. You had me at, ""bacon,"" on this one. When I tried it though, all I tasted was the black pepper chili sauce. The very last piece had no sauce on it whatsoever. THAT bite was delicious. I never thought of bacon in sushi, but so help me, it worked. If there was either no sauce, or a light sauce, it would have been superb. The bacon is the selling point of that roll. Why would you hide it behind the sauce? Let it shine!   Pebble Beach: This one sounded odd, but I figured it deserved a try. Still not sure I got one. When I looked down I, literally, saw nothing but sauce. it was SMOTHERED in a ranch sauce (ranch? really?) and pink sauce. I couldn't see any sushi under it. Trying to eat it, I only tasted SAUUUUUUCE. Notice a theme here?   Literally, the only balanced part of my meal was the sweet tea.  I like the idea of being original and innovative, but you gotta get the basics right. Dial back the sauces, retool some of the recipes and I would be willing to try again. Until then I would not recommend this and I will continue driving out to Gulfport for my sushi fix.","['Sushi Restaurant', 'Japanese Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant']",109371731041719485187,1390712006,"Jan 25, 2014",100749073179623107860

The only problem was that when I asked for a box to take home the remaining 4 pieces of my sushi roll, the server informed me that they no longer give out boxes and that the management was ""really cracking down on this"". I understand people ordering take out on $3 sushi night because some people take advantage, but I am still a paying customer and it sounds a bit ridiculous not to be able to take home food that was paid for. That isn't the worst part; before I asked for a box, my friend received a sushi roll that had a hair on it and the server did not apologize or try to make the situation better. She was not friendly at all and it seemed like she really did not want to be there. Management did not touch upon the table or even bother with the situation and the roll took an extended amount of time to be remade. This experience made me a bit upset, therefore this is probably the last time that I go to The Garden, especially on this particular ""$3 sushi roll night"".

Potato salad was low grocery store quality.  The liver dumpling soup was awful, maybe it's traditional Czech, but I've had much better from German restaurants, the broth was more of a turkey broth, and the liver dumplings didn't have much flavor.

0,3.0,Ron Sadaka,"It looks like I might be the lone dissenter here, BUT - Can we all agree that marinara sauce, spaghetti & meatballs, garlic rolls and something as simple as the Parmesan cheese served are fair indicators of how ALL the rest of any Italian menu will turn-out? Can we agree that an Italian red sauce or gravy that contains sugar and is totally devoid of ANY fresh herbs demonstrates something less than a commitment to excellence and love for one's cooking (can you say ""Ragu?"")? Can we agree that meatballs without even one fresh parsley or basil leaf is simply... well WRONG?! And what proud Italian chef in a fine-dining environment serves his prize Parmesan  cheese from a shake bottle - no offer to freshly grate or shave it at the table? Do you prefer your garlic rolls with a delicate hint of garlic in a rich extra-virgin olive oil drizzle, or rather smothered in some mix of oil whose flavor is now overpowered by a mound of crushed garlic - Enough to have you chewing Orbit gum for the rest of the evening. Ok well by now you know I am really not a fan. The errors here are so egregious that I cannot imagine the kitchen staff possessing the talent or skill necessary to provide any noteworthy improvement to the food experience. Ambiance aside (really a nice comfortable interior environment), this is your basic mediocre Italian-American, neighborhood pizza joint with cheap, outdated recipes and sub-par kitchen skills. Ok back to the food - Meatballs were WAY too salty and no fresh herbs in them. The spaghetti was overcooked. The sauce tasted worse than Ragu in the bottle. The famous garlic rolls... well... WAY too much garlic. Even the salad greens were stale! And - The place was NOT cheap! I guess if there were not so many positive reviews here, I would have been less harsh, but  c'mon folks, with all the GREAT restaurant choices in Miami, do we really have to accept this level of mediocre?

0,1.0,nikki church,"I normally do not do reviews but I feel this place deserved one. My husband and I decided to have dinner here one night after he finished work. I always drive by and it smells so good. We get there and find a place to sit outside. The place was not busy at all. We got seated and ordered our drinks. It took awhile for our drinks to arrive. No big deal we thought, it was a nice evening. We looked over the menu and was thinking we would get large servings for the high price. I ordered a pull pork sandwich and my husband did the brisket and for sides, we did the mac and cheese and a side salad with ranch. We were disappointed when to see the small portions of food that we received. Mind you not, we lived in Texas for a long time and we know our BBQ. The mac and cheese was dry and had no flavor and the ranch dressing on the salad tasted like they dumped the entire shaker into it. Needless to say, it was not good at all. My sandwich was OK to be nice about it and my husband did not eat all of his brisket because it did not taste good and it was tough. To top it off, as I was finishing my water, I noticed that there was a fly that was frozen in one of the ice cubes. Being pregnant and seeing that made me sick to my stomach.   Well on our way back home, we told each other that we would not eat here again, nor would be recommend it to anyone. The worse part about everything is that we both ended up with food poisoning the next day. Needless to say, we will not eat at this establishment again.","['Barbecue Restaurant', 'Seafood Restaurant', 'Wi-Fi Spot']",100016700518027743095,1380999348,"Oct 5, 2013",101016957161848314733

0,2.0,Nat Gadelrab,"Are you planning on going to this place? Please read the reviews! Notice that  every positive review is written by people that have been going there for decades and are friends of the Studiale family.   I have lived in South Florida for more than 20 years and have always been curious about this place. Many of my local friends have advised me over the years not to go there but like they say you learn from your own mistakes and this,  was a really big one.   A couple of weeks ago I came across a groupon for Tropical Acres and thought what better way to test out the newly renovated restaurant?  We had reservations for 8 pm on Friday 6/8/2012 we were greeted by an overly rude hostess and totally rude owner who seemed to have no people skills.  We were ushered to the bar and spent money there on drinks. 8:39 pm we were finally seated, remember we had reservations. We handed over our Groupons to our waitress, she claimed it was fine.  Service was slow, but hey it gave us time to socialize in a depressing, dull and bad smelling atmosphere. We ordered our food at around 9pm. At 9:45 we were told that there was no more prime rib, we are at a steak house, no prime rib, what kind of steak house is this? We changed one of the orders, which was really no big deal.   At 10:10 the first two meals were served, hallelujah! At this point we could care less what the food was, we were beyond starving! At about 10:20 everybody at the table had there meal. The new York strip was overcooked and tough, the scallops were not fresh and the kids chicken tenders were comparable to less than what you would expect from a  fast food Restaurant.  As if that wasn't bad enough at around 10:45 the hostess, with an extremely big ego told us that we could only use one groupon because we were all seated at one huge table. However at the time of seating our waitress said it was perfectly fine as long as we had 4 or more meals on each check, which was no problem because we were a party of 9.   The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, one waitress gave us the ok after checking with management, while the hostess rudely told us that we could only use one Groupon.  We asked for management and were bluntly told ""Not to be so F**king rude!"" Thanks for expanding my young daughters vocabulary.  The owner/manager came to our table with a snotty attitude.  I had my friend take my daughter outside because I expected her to use more profanity.  As they say monkey see, monkey do I was afraid she would pick up on the owners attrocious vocabulary.    I calmly explained our situation to the owner and her reply was ""You don't want to pay? I'm calling BSO (Broward Sheriff Office)"" And rudely stormed off, with both of our Groupons and checks.  At this point I could care less if I got the discount I just wanted to pay the bill and get out of this musky smelling hell hole.  After getting a partial discount for one of the Groupons we paid our bill and decided, it's time to go home. On the way out we were complimented on being ""White Trash"" because we were ""too cheap to pay the full bill and had to get a discount."" The BSO officers advised us to call Groupon, contact our credit cards and write reviews on the Internet.  Well here you have it SOFLA, Tropical Acres is an overrated tourist trap, so next time you're looking for a nice atmosphere and good, prompt service.  Do yourself a huge favor, DON'T GO TO TROPICAL ACRES!!","['Steak House', 'Seafood Restaurant', 'Wedding Venue']",115757957627721988675,1339463362,"Jun 11, 2012",101034088988926868023

They remind me of the pizza I enjoyed on my many trips to Italy...but better in a way, as the ingredients that top these pizzas are a delightful mix of the unexpected!   The atmosphere is dark and romantic and you get your pizza right out of the brick oven that's on display. It's really nice that the owner is almost always there, and he stops by the tables to have little chats to make sure everyone's enjoying themselves.

There's a bit of a wait since it's kind of small, but the patio is comfy to wait in.  We ordered the garlic bread, insalata caprese, linguine alla vongole, and the gnocchi bolognese.  Since I went with a gf and her bf hates cheese, we piled on the garlic and mozzarella.  Garlic bread was a little tough for my liking that it kind of hurt for me to eat.  I'm not fond of super crunchy bread.  The salad has balls of mozzarella, but it wasn't too heavy/cheesy to the point of ruining our meal.  My linguine had plenty of clams and the lemon zest was definitely noticeable but I still liked it.  My friend swears on the gnocchi but she was a bit disappointed since it didn't come out piping hot, which probably would've made it taste much better.  Neither of us finished our dishes though since they are huge portions.  I was very happy to have leftovers for the next day.

Tomato Bistro was exactly what I was looking for! We sat upstairs, under a gorgeous chandelier, and was served by the sweetest waitress. For drinks we each got the beer sampler. All four were great, but I highly recommend the pair cider. We ordered a greek vegetable appetizer which was new to me but amazing nonetheless. For our main dishes we each got a different type of pizza. My guacamole pizza was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I even took home the left overs. I NEVER do that. When we were leaving, a solo guitarist and singer was downstairs playing 90's rock. So sad I had to leave, because that is exactly what I was looking for.

0,2.0,Traveler Foodie,"This is Puerto Rican Island style BBQ. Non of that southern style with sauces. There is an array of Puerto Rican food served from a buffet style table. Look, order; to go or dine in; pay and off you go. If it is dine in, everything is served on disposable plates and bowls. One would self serve and self buss. There is also the standard flan, tres leches, and island style locally made drinks.  Here is the kicker, every Sunday they roast a whole pig Puerto Rican style in the restaurant! Yea, they have a full concrete block area under a standard restaurant fire and exhaust hood. A whole pig. The Roast pork was tender, succulent and loads of flavor. Rich rosemary, thyme, and black peppercorns stood out. Watch out for the pig hairs. BBQ pork had a nice sweet tangy flavor but was very tough in texture. Rotisserie chicken  was tender, juicey, and flavorful.  BBQ Beans and Yucca (cassava) packed tons of flavors. Sweet plantains (maduros) was nice and firm, with a sweet balance.  The Mofongo was dry and husky, no flavors.  Flan and Tres Leches were ….. let’s move on.  This is a neighboring restaurant that caters to a predominantly Spanish speaking clientele. Be patient and wait for the English speaking staff. Apart from the whole roasted pig, I am not so sure it was a whole pig could have been large pieces, the food was just okay. Nothing special. No stand outs, just okay. There was a huge sign that advertised a special soup every Sunday, on this occasion–nada. No advertised food, poor communication, okay food, go figure.",['Barbecue Restaurant'],110015528817131971242,1311797874,"Jul 27, 2011",101229771818692842087

I gave them a few weeks to get the kinks worked out and went for an early dinner first of all the place is beautiful, romantic but professional with cavernous ceilings and lovely gentle but energetic lighting. I loved the open kitchen with the wall that changed colors. The wine list was appropriate for the area with enough diversity to satisfy my Zinfandel drinking mother in law and my more self righteous tastes with a relaxed tempranillo. We started with the papusa, crispy outer layer filled with some wonderfully flavorful chorizo sausage, I'm salivating just remembering it :) and now they have it on Happy hour special? For dinner I had the lamb stew (enormous portion size) It was flavorful and hearty, perfect for the chilly misty weather we've been having. The texture of the hominy with the melt in your mouth chunks of lamb made me very happy inside. My mother in law who has a less explorative palate had the grilled chicken and for once had nothing negative to say. The salsa was so fresh, slightly sweet and very tasty. We couldn't leave without trying the churros which came with two count em 2! chocolate dipping sauces, big crispy sugared dough doused in marshmallow sauce? orgasmic. go here. love it.","['Caribbean Restaurant', 'Bar', 'Cuban Restaurant']",105634448382389233505,1286152496,"Oct 3, 2010",101242927802808684236

The ribs are divine - lightly crusted with seasoning to seal in the juices.  BBQ sauces are served in squirt bottles on the side, to customize as you wish.  Too bad ""BBQ"" has a public persona of soppy meat drenched in catsup drool - if that's your template, go get a McRib!  We ordered the BBQ Sampler with a Mess O' Greens.  For those who stumble through this Western mining town with an angst-ridden past, count your blessings that you can sip on a huckleberry margarita and savor the real deal in meats.

I followed him inside and another employee asked me what the problem was, then he proceeded to go to the back and came out with a gallon of antifreeze.

First, the tables are so crammed together that it might as well be a family style restaurant.  I did not enjoy having to listen to the dinner conversations of every table around us.    Second, the location of the restaurant itself is ... frightening would be the best word.  Certainly not somewhere I would want to be after dark.    Third, the food was gross.  Our table ordered the sea bass, duck, lamb and each dish I tried was worse than the one before.  We had appetizers as well; I was not impressed by anything I ate.    Fourth, the waitstaff is not friendly. Salt Lake City has a classic service-oriented atmosphere and this restaurant certainly missed the memo.    There wasn't anything about our dining experience that I enjoyed.  Between the 5 of us who could find something that sounded edible enough to eat, we spent about $250.  It was late when we left and we all ate so little of our food that we ended up stopping for fast food on the way home, it was much more enjoyable.","['Mexican Restaurant', 'Latin American Restaurant', 'Event Planner']",114479863718632379659,1358897209,"Jan 22, 2013",101368004366647353409

I have also tried KC, St Louis and Texas bbq, and was super excited to finally mark Memphis bbq off my list. This is perhaps the worst bbq I have ever eaten, and if this is the standard for Memphis bbq, then I never want to try it again.  I had the pulled pork plate, with sides of beans and slaw. The pork was absolutely gross. It tasted like it had been cooked in a crock pot, and it had absolutely no flavor at all. Now, the sauces were actually pretty decent, especially the hot bbq sauce (tasted like it was maybe made with whiskey); however, the basis for great bbq starts with the meat, and poor meat cannot be saved by a good sauce. The slaw was disgusting and bland. It seriously seemed like only cabbage and mayo. Now, the beans actually were quite good, and I probably could have made a meal of just the beans alone.  The only reason why I gave this place two stars is because the workers were very nice. If you are reading this, I would really consider NOT eating bbq (at least the pulled pork) here.",['Barbecue Restaurant'],106123671291455820782,1386464258,"Dec 7, 2013",101499878920098566453

0,5.0,Jen TheCat,WE STRUCK GOLD!!!!  We wanted Chinese food and we found this place.  Don't go here if you want your average cheap Chinese take-out (wok)... this is MUCH better than that (Although it does do take-out).  It doesn't do it justice calling it a Chinese restaurant because the variety is Asian than specifically Chinese.   I had the Sushi and it was very good!   The portions are very large.  The staff was FANTASTIC!!  They have a great sense of humor and were extremely friendly.  What impressed me greatly was the cleanliness of the restaurant and bathrooms.   I would have expected to pay a lot more than I did for this quality of restaurant but I was shocked to see how reasonable the price was despite the large portions we received.  I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant if you're in the Bloomington area.  I will be going there again and my 9 year old said she wants to go there every night..,"['Chinese Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'Sushi Restaurant']",113272225178327879401,1377395982,"Aug 24, 2013",101571198291771736680

The drink orders were irrelevant, however, since we never got any refills at all.  Some of our party stated they had allergies, explained them, and then ordered their food with special requests to avoid the offending items.  Despite this double warning, when we got the food, none of the special requests had been made and everything had to be sent back.    I will say the food arrived quickly.  I had no technical problems with my order, however the food was utterly lackluster.  I got the barbecue sampler, which was a disappointment.  The BBQ chicken was simply a grilled chicken breast with a bit of BBQ sauce on it.  The pulled pork quite simply was not good.  The ribs were actually quite tasty.  The green beans on the side had had the life cooked out of them and had clearly been sitting around for some time.  I'd have to say the star of my plate was the plain baked potato, which they somehow managed.

0,5.0,Howard Callihan,"There is a particular type of Chinese restaurant whose excellence is comprised of little touches.  While the menu does not significantly differ from that of any typical Chinese restaurant, the handling of the dishes shows an overall care.  The quality and freshness of ingredients are all a touch above basic.  The table service format strikes a perfect balance between family diner and white napkin, as do the prices.  At these establishments, the overall menu is consistently good, with a few signature items you can only go so long without craving.  Panda Garden is such a restaurant.  Their Pan Fried Noodles are to die for.  Their Steamed Dumplings are drool inspiring.  The flavors of their Bubble Tea are a little generic, but they handle the tapioca pearls better than anyone in town (offered only for dine-in or carry-out).  All of this alone would make for a quality restaurant, but the thing that makes Panda Garden utterly unique is the owner.  She is the combined essence of entrepreneur and grandma.  I have seen her charm children away from their mothers to the land of coloring books and dolls with zero thought of alarm.  I have never seen her equal in self-promotion. Rather than feeling that you're getting a sales pitch, you feel that she just wants you to love the place as much as she does—and it’s hard not to.","['Chinese Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'Bar']",102776119410470571850,1361179517,"Feb 18, 2013",101740970880752499750

The EGG had tons of flavor which was a good surprise. Overall pretttttttttttty good ramen. I'd give it 4 stars but I feel they messed up on one of the key components - the noodles. My noodles were under cooked and were too chewy for my liking. The portions were also too small for the price. 13$ and I was hungry 10 minutes after eating. I feel like noodles are cheap, just throw a bunch in there to fill us up.

This buffet may not have alot but it has all the healthy stuff rather then having a load of fried unhealthy material like a lot of places do have.

The people their are really nice and polite you ask for a refill and they are not reluctant to fill it up like at other buffets. They have nice mannerisms and smile and they always clear your plates so you don't have a mountain pile of dishes at your table.

I'll start by saying that it took nearly 45 minutes to receive my order, which is sometimes understandable. I understand I'm not the only customer they deliver to, so that's almost forgivable. My problem is that once my food made it to my apartment, it was messy and the ice in my drinks had COMPLETELY melted. There was not one bit of ice left in my drinks, and they tasted terrible. I've seen how much ice goes into those drinks and for mine to be totally melted was not cool. The guy who delivered to me this last time brought my food to my door and commented that he had to run back to get my drinks. He sat my bag of food ON THE GROUND IN FRONT OF ME instead of handing it directly to me, which is heaps uncool. Why on earth would you sit my bag of food on the ground? WHY? All in all, I've ordered from this location many, many times without incident.

0,3.0,Jonny Doey,"Hooters, a place where a man can enjoy gourmet made from scratch food from the endless menu items, and a upscale place to take a date where servers are known for their high intellect and amazing set of useful skills.  Ok, who am I kidding? This is your average run of the mill Hooters and here is my review.  The Good:  The Food- I ordered Fish and Chips and the food was not only hot, but it had a decent taste to it. I usually order the wings, but I wanted to be daring and try something new.  Prices- Its Hooters, so the prices are reasonable.  The Bad:  The Deception- The name of the place is Hooters, which could be slang for an Owl or a set of big bodacious bahama mamas. Neither were present at the restaurant. The server with the biggest bust size was probably a 34 BBB. While I dont discriminate against women with small chesticals, at a place called hooters, the lack of hooters could be deemed false advertisement.  The Service- It took 5 minutes to be seated and give my drink order when the restaurant was at 35% capacity. The food also took a while to come out.  Overall: If you like chicken wings that are sold at a reasonable price and you like to watch sports outside of the home, this is the place for you. If you are looking to take some of your church members to an elegant venue for lunch or dinner, you might want to stick with Red Lobster.

After dinning at LaBelleVie in downtown Minneapolis the night before we again thoroughly enjoyed our dinners at ZA!  Delicious and tasty were the CheeseTortellini with Black Tiger Shrimp and the Capicollo (ham) Slurp.  We always find the service good and the meals presented are made to order.  On a side note I find the steaks taste better than most ""steak houses"".

The sandwich came and there was a spot of cheese on one of the halves. I had a horrible taste in my mouth and intestinal pains until the next day, from the soup I believe. I think it was loaded with MSG. I do not know what happened to this place. It is terrible. It was so good many months ago. Terrible food, great service. The waitress was very nice and very sorry.

Considering how much fresh product this place has, really, really, fresh product why you would complain about a batter that is a little bland when you have wonderful fresh fish to TASTE instead sort of eludes me.  But hey, there's no accounting for matters of taste.  We had fresh lunch specials, Cobia & Sea Bass.  The two different preparations were both right on the money.  Service was prompt on a Sunday noon with a busy dining room.  Our food was delivered after an appropriate preparation time.  And the complimentary smoked fish appetizer was a nice way to spend the waiting time.

0,4.0,Wandering Wanderer,"I am a fan of wrestling and lucha libre as well, and well when I heard about this place, I wanted to go there with a few friends who also like wrestling. First off, the place is small and it is the definition of a ‘gimmick restaurant’ but in a totally good way. The walls are covered with lucha posters, masks, action figures and other lucha related stuff. Also on the other side are old lucha movies being projected on the wall (with no sound) which is actually pretty entertaining since it’s so old and cheesy.  Now you can’t expect something like a full meal with all the fixings on this place but it’s a good place to get a small bite. The food is small but it has a nice flavor to what you’re eating, plus everything is named after lucha moves and wrestlers. The service was also great and helped made the whole experience seem much better. It’s well worth to even go there at least once to feel the whole lucha experience… and to get your check given to you in a mini lucha mask on a mini wrestling ring.","['Mexican Restaurant', 'Latin American Restaurant']",104357209688998434669,1276391471,"Jun 12, 2010",102255987194016247694
